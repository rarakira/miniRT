# miniRT (Raytracing)

MiniRT is a program that can render 3D scenes using raytracing technique using [MiniLibX](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/introduction.html) library. Subject can be found [here](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/47303/en.subject.pdf).

## Project goals

* Get familiar with raytracing
* Render 3D scenes with geometric objects using linear algebra
* Work with light, shading and texturing
* Implement scene navigation, object selection and modification
